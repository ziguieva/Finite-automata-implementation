Create a program that allows to define, simulate and visualize deterministic finite automata (AFD) and non-deterministic finite automata (AFND).

Features:
- Interface to enter the states, transitions and symbols of an automaton.
- Algorithm for verifying the membership of a string in the language recognized by the automaton.
- Conversion of a non-deterministic automaton into a deterministic automaton.
- Graphical visualization of the automaton and its recognition process.
